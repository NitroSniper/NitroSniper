###### Hello! 
My name is Nitro Sniper, Most call me Nitro for short
I’m an 18 yr old Undergraduate and just been learning what interesting to me.
This Github is primarily used to store some codes which I'm proud enough to actually post on
* Python: My first language and very confident with it. 
* Rust: Wanting my code to be faster, effecient and safe. 

Interested in AI but still looking around
